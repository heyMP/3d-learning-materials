# maya-3d-modeling-and-rendering-iteration

### Assignment Brief:
In this assignment, you will interpret the feedback on your submission for last assignment. Feedback is not a judgment on you, rather a description, evaluation, analysis, and judgment of your work so that you may improve the work. You may get a wide range of feedback (often conflicting), and it is up to you to decide what is useful and what you will decide to ignore when making design decisions.

Please use feedback and your own judgment to make iterative improvements to your model, lighting, and other formal and technical aspects of your image.
